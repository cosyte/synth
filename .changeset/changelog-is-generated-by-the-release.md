`CHANGELOG.md`, which ships inside the tarball, is now written by the release instead of by hand, so it stops describing already-published code as unreleased.

`.changeset/config.json` set `"changelog": false`, so no release ever wrote a version heading
into `CHANGELOG.md` and nothing ever rolled `[Unreleased]` over. Every published version of this
package therefore carried a changelog with **no version headings at all**: one `[Unreleased]`
heading over the whole history, and a preamble stating that the first pre-alpha release "will
ship" the initial public API surface listed below it. That promise was already in the future tense
in the very tarball that fulfilled it, and it stayed in the future tense through every release
after. `CHANGELOG.md` is listed in `package.json` `files`, so this was text on the disk of everyone
who installed the package, not internal bookkeeping.

**The flag is what changed, not the prose.** Correcting the sentence by hand would have left the
mechanism that wrote it in place, and the next release would have drifted the same way.
`changelog` now names the generator that ships with Changesets, so a release writes its own
version heading and its own entry from the changesets it consumed, and **the changeset summary is
now the changelog entry**. Nothing new is depended on: the generator is an entry point of
`@changesets/cli`, which was already a dev dependency.

**The file's shape changed with it, deliberately.** Changesets prepends a release by replacing the
first newline in the file, so exactly one line can sit above generated output. The hand-written
preamble sat on line 3, which means a release would have inserted itself between the heading and
the preamble and split the header in two. The hand-maintained history has therefore moved under a
`## Released before this file was generated` heading, with the false preamble replaced by an
accurate one. Three pieces of hand-workflow scaffolding were dropped and no entry was reworded:
the `[Unreleased]` heading, its link definition at the foot of the file, and the two empty section
stubs (`### Deprecated` and `### Removed`) waiting for the next hand-written entry. The history
itself is left as it was written rather than re-sorted into version sections, because the file
never recorded which release each entry went out in and the text is already on disk in published
copies.

**Changesets' Prettier pass is deliberately left ON here, and that was derived from this repo
rather than copied from a sibling.** This repo has no `.prettierignore` at all and its
`format:check` globs root markdown, so `CHANGELOG.md` is inside the repo's own formatting gate and
its archived history is already Prettier-canonical. Both directions were measured. With the pass
on, the archived history comes through a release byte identical, so leaving it on costs nothing.
With the pass off, what `changeset version` itself writes is no longer Prettier-canonical even for
the simplest possible summary, because it writes the version heading and `### Patch Changes` on
adjacent lines with no blank line between them. **A sentence a sibling carries is false here and
is deliberately not repeated**: this repo's `version` script also runs `prettier --write` over
`CHANGELOG.md` one link after `changeset version`, where a sibling's covers only `package.json`
and `src/index.ts`, so turning the pass off here would not open the Version PR red and would not
keep Prettier away from the archived history either. It would only leave the tool's own output
failing the gate that covers the file it wrote, which buys nothing. A sibling whose
`.prettierignore` lists `*.md` needs the opposite setting, and resyncing the value between repos is
how a release starts rewriting already-published text.

Pinned by `test/scripts/changelog-generation.test.ts`, which runs the real `changeset version`
against the real `CHANGELOG.md` and the real config in a throwaway package rather than
reimplementing where the tool inserts text. Nine of its fifteen cases are red against the previous
state, measured on the tree this change was written against rather than recalled. The throwaway
package is a real git repository, because the generator prefixes each entry with the short commit
sha that added the changeset and a tree with no history would exercise a line shape no release
writes. **The rule it enforces is that nothing but the H1 sits above the first heading, and it is
asserted on the released document as well as the committed one**: a rule phrased as "the archive
heading comes second" holds only until the first release writes its own version heading there,
which would have redded the first Version PR this configuration ever opened. Every version-heading
comparison is a whole-heading match rather than a substring, demonstrated on real generator output,
because this package sits past the point where `## 0.0.1` is a prefix of a heading it does not
have. Three further controls: the same inputs with `"changelog": false` must write no version
heading at all, so the flag is proved load-bearing rather than incidental; the same inputs with the
Prettier pass off must produce a document this repo's own formatting gate rejects; and the old file
shape must reproduce the split header, so the shape rule is demonstrated rather than asserted.

One upstream behaviour is worth knowing before debugging a release, and is recorded in that file:
Changesets wraps the changelog write in a try/catch that only warns. A tree whose declared Prettier
config cannot be resolved bumps the version, consumes the changeset, and writes no changelog at all.
A release that publishes with an unchanged changelog is that failure, not a setting that quietly
reverted.

`.changeset/README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` said to add the entry to `CHANGELOG.md` by hand and now say
to write it in the changeset. No runtime code, no public API, no warning code, no generated byte and
no synthetic-safety behaviour changed.
